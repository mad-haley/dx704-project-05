Acknowledgments

I used the DX704 course-provided code examples as a reference when developing the code for this assignment.

I referenced the following notebook from the course repo:
https://github.com/bu-cds-omds/dx704-examples/blob/main/week01/chart_risk_return_performance_of_efficient_portfolios.ipynb
I also used reddit and youtube.
Lastly, my partner is a robotics engineer at Google
and I double-checked my code with him.
